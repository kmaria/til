### Authentication

Authentication is used when there is a necessity to know who is accessing pieces of data or information to create accountability – protecting the Confidentiality element of the CIA triad.

### CIA Triad

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Finding the right mix of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability is a balancing act.

This is really the corner stone of IT Security – finding the RIGHT mix for your organization.
- Too much **Confidentiality** and the Availability can suffer.
- Too much **Integrity** and the Availability can suffer.
- Too much **Availability** and both the Confidentiality and Integrity can suffer.

The opposites of the CIA Triad is DAD (Disclosure, Alteration and Destruction).
- **Disclosure** – Someone not authorized gets access to your information.
- **Alteration** – Your data has been changed.
- **Destruction** – Your Data or Systems has been Destroyed or rendered inaccessible.

### Fuzzing

Put simply, fuzzing is an automated means of testing an element of a web application until the application gives a vulnerability or valuable information. When we are fuzzing, we provide information as we would typically when interacting with it, just at a much faster rate. This means that we can use extensive lists known as wordlists to test a web application’s response to various information.
