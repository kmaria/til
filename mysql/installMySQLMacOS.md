## Install MySQL 5.7 on macOS

### Install Homebrew
* Installing Homebrew is effortless, open Terminal and enter :  
 `$  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

### Install MySQL
At this time of writing, Homebrew has MySQL version **8** as default, but as we're aiming to get **5.7** :

`$ brew install mysql@5.7`
